Stabilize Me!



Description:
------------

Soldiers gain the ability to Stabilize any other soldier that is bleeding out and happens to be carrying a medikit.
In other words: use the wounded soldier's own Medikit to patch him up.

No more bleeding out deaths for your medics! As long as the incapacitated soldier has a Medikit with at least one charge left he can be stabilized by anyone.

This mod is open source. The source along with documentation is available in Github, https://github.com/Jusas/XCOM2StabilizeMe

** Update 2016-04-07

Improved the checking of the stabilize ability from the victim soldier. The mod is now compatible with the Field Medic class mod (tested).
The underlying mechanic now checks for all abilities for the victim and seeks for any that have the "remove effect" that removes the "bleed out effect", and then checks that the ability has at least one charge left. This should make it compatible with most mods out of the box.
